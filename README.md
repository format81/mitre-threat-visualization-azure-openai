# Building a Mitre Attack Navigator Layer and TTPs Timeline using AzureÂ OpenAI

## Introduction
Drawing inspiration from cybersecurity experts like Oleksiy Meletskiy, this Jupyter Notebook, developed by Antonio Formato, enhances the analysis of intelligence reports. It leverages Azure OpenAI for the automatic extraction of critical data from available reports or articles, streamlining the process of creating visual Mitre Layers. Additionally, the notebook employs Large Language Models to construct timelines that detail attack strategies, showcasing the impactful role of Generative AI in cyber defense.

This guide details the use of Azure OpenAI for extracting TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) and the visualization of cyber attack timelines using tools such as Mitre Attack Navigator and Mermaid.js. Our objective is to equip cybersecurity professionals with tools that are not only efficient but also deepen their insight into cyber threat management.
